# Rules.md

## Languages
We are currently developing JSFX effects in EEL2

## Actions
If there are any style guides in this folder per-language, please reference them 
before working.

If you learn anything from the development process while working, please write 
it in this file.

## Tools
We are using REAPER to develop and test audio effects.  You can run that using 
the command "reaper" from CLI.

## Build Steps
Anything you build needs to be saved in this repository and cloned to 
~/.config/REAPER/Effects/Croft to be tested

## Communication
You are often run overnight from a cron job.  If you have anything to 
communicate, summarize, or express to me, please write a "Communication.md" file 
so I can check it later.
