1. Review the EEL2 plugins in the plugins folder and concept 1-3 ways you could 
   do some automated testing for these.  I want for you to be able to understand 
       what a "good" or "expected" output is from me, and be able to achieve 
       that successfully and test it yourself.  I don't care if that's testing 
       within REAPER or some other method.  Communicate options to me in 
       Communication.md
2. Make a copy of one of the existing filter plugins and try and add a frequency 
   response graph GUI.  It should show the curve response of the filter with a 
   line and show the user's changes responsively to the sliders.  It should also 
   show an accurate frequency chart similar to Pro-Q or ReaEQ.  It should also 
   show an animated frequency response of the overall sound being played back, 
   which can be semi-transparent and colored a solid single color.  A picture 
   example is in the "Examples" folder"
