1. Continue improving the frequency response graph GUI in `plugins/BiquadLowPassGraphPrototype.jsfx`.
   Remaining work:
   - Continue refining visual accuracy and polish to feel closer to Pro-Q or ReaEQ
   - Reference the example image in `docs/Examples/pro-q-4-highlight-spectral-poster.jpg`
2. After refining frequency graph and having approval (will show up in this 
   document) archive old Low Pass Filter and make the Graph Prototype called 
   "Low Pass Filter (NIR)"
3. After low pass filter is approved, make a matching High Pass Filter
