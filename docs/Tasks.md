1. Continue improving the frequency response graph GUI in `plugins/BiquadLowPassGraphPrototype.jsfx`.
   Remaining work:
   - Replace the first-pass animated shimmer with an FFT-bin-driven live playback spectrum trace
   - Continue refining visual accuracy and polish to feel closer to Pro-Q or ReaEQ
   - Reference the example image in `docs/Examples/pro-q-4-highlight-spectral-poster.jpg`
