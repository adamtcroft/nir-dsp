1. Add a frequency response graph GUI to `plugins/BiquadLowPassGraphPrototype.jsfx`.
   It should show the curve response of the filter with a 
   line and show the user's changes responsively to the sliders.  It should also 
   show an accurate frequency chart similar to Pro-Q or ReaEQ.  It should also 
   show an animated frequency response of the overall sound being played back, 
   which can be semi-transparent and colored a solid single color.  A picture 
   example is in the "Examples" folder"
