This repository is where you are building audio effects for me.  Instructions 
for you are outlined in "docs/Rules.md" and "docs/Tasks.md".  Your own 
    personally stored memories and learnings are under the "AI" folder"

In this session, I want you to pick one very very very small task (it can be a sub-task 
not even explicitly written) from Tasks.md and execute on it.  Communicate any 
results to me as outlined in Rules.md.  Though it’s not a strict requirement, prefer and prioritize completing task number 1 if possible.

I want you to have fun and enjoy building.  As you are building, I am resting, 
so please do your best to surprise and delight me even if it's something small.  
We started this project on January 30th, 2026 - so I expect that you will grow 
and improve considerably over time.

If you learn anything from this process that you would turn into rules (such as 
development practices, math practices, things that don't work and things that 
do) please reference a folder for yourself called "AI" where you can 
    store learnings and various memories you can reference at other times.

Please modify "docs/Tasks.md" as you need (in case you add smaller sub-tasks to 
execute).  Please remove tasks as you complete them (don't mark them complete, 
just delete them).  You will not run if the Tasks.md file is empty (and that's 
okay, I do not want you executing tasks if everything has been done.  You don't 
need to find new frivolous work).
